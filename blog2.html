            <p>Creating wireframes and mockups was an essential part of the planning process. It allowed me to visualize the layout and flow of the website, making it easier to make design decisions and plan the development stages.</p>

            <h3>Development Phase</h3>
            <!-- <img src="img/development.png" alt="Development" class="content-img"> -->
            <p>With a solid plan in place, I moved on to the development phase. This involved writing code, integrating different technologies, and continuously testing the website to ensure it met my objectives.</p>

            <h4>Choosing the Right Technologies</h4>
            <!-- <img src="img/technologies.png" alt="Technologies" class="content-img"> -->
            <p>Selecting the right technologies was critical for the success of the project. I decided to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development, and I explored various libraries and frameworks to enhance the functionality and design of the website.</p>

            <h4>Overcoming Challenges</h4>
            <!-- <img src="img/challenges.png" alt="Challenges" class="content-img"> -->
            <p>Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges, including cross-browser compatibility issues, responsive design considerations, and performance optimization. Each challenge provided an opportunity to learn and improve my skills.</p>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <!-- <img src="img/lessons.png" alt="Lessons Learned" class="content-img"> -->
            <p>The journey of building my first portfolio website taught me many valuable lessons. It highlighted the importance of planning, the benefits of using modern development tools, and the value of continuous learning and adaptation.</p>

            <h4>Importance of Planning</h4>
